# Uniswap V2 SwapRouter Integration with Custom Smart Contract

This project demonstrates how to create a custom Ethereum smart contract that interacts with Uniswap V2's SwapRouter for token swapping using Hardhat.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm: [Install Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/).
- Alchemy API Key: You'll need an Alchemy API Key to access the Ethereum network. Obtain one by signing up at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-uniswap-v2-smart-contract
   ```

2. **Set Up Alchemy API Key**:

   Open the `hardhat.config.js` file and replace `<your-alchemy-api-key>` with your actual Alchemy API Key:

   ```javascript
     networks:{
     hardhat:{
      forking:{
         url:"your-alchemy-api-key"
      }
     }
  },
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start a Local Hardhat Node**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

5. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**:

   Run the deployment script to deploy your custom smart contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```

6. **Replace Deployed Contract Address**:

   Open the `test/swappingTest.js` file and replace `<your-deployed-contract-address>` with the actual address of your deployed smart contract:

   ```javascript
   let swapContractAddress = "<your-deployed-contract-address>";
   ```

7. **Run Tests**:

   Execute the tests to verify your smart contract's interaction with Uniswap V2's SwapRouter:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test --network localhost
   ```
